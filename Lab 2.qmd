## 1. Filtering Rows

### Question 1: Read in the dataset and use `glimpse()`

```{r}
tree_dat <- read.csv("data/tree_dat.csv")
glimpse(tree_dat)
```

Using glimpse() gives you a summary of the dataset structure including rows, columns, and variable types.

### Question 2: Count records in stand 1

```{r}
n_stand_1 <- tree_dat %>% filter(standID == 1) %>% nrow()
n_stand_1
```

There are 979 records in stand 1.

### Question 3: Count records for species "Abies balsamea" and "Pinus strobus"

```{r}
n_species <- tree_dat %>% 
  filter(species %in% c("ABBA", "PIST")) %>% 
  count(species)
n_species
```

There are 13,033 ABBA records and 4,188 PIST records.

### Question 4: Count trees older than 200 years in the last year of dataset

```{r}
last_year <- max(tree_dat$year)
old_trees <- tree_dat %>% 
  filter(year == last_year, age > 200) %>% 
  nrow()
old_trees
```

There are 7 trees older than 200 yo.

## 2. Slicing Rows

### Question 5: Oldest tree using `slice_max()`

```{r}
oldest_tree <- tree_dat %>% 
  slice_max(age, n = 1)
oldest_tree
```

The oldest tree is 269 yo.

### Question 6: Oldest 5 trees recorded in 2001

```{r}
oldest_2001 <- tree_dat %>% 
  filter(year == 2001) %>% 
  slice_max(age, n = 5)
oldest_2001
```

The oldest 5 trees in 2001 are 263, 259, 212, 206, and 206 yo.

### Question 7: Number of trees in a 30% sample of 2002 records

```{r}
trees_2002 <- tree_dat %>% filter(year == 2002)
sample_size <- round(nrow(trees_2002) * 0.30)
sample_2002 <- trees_2002 %>% slice_sample(n = sample_size)
nrow(sample_2002)
```

There are 687 trees in a 30% sample from 2002.

## 3. Arranging Rows

### Question 8: Top 3 trees in stand 5 (2007) sorted by `rad_ib`

```{r}
top_trees <- tree_dat %>% 
  filter(standID == 5, year == 2007) %>% 
  arrange(desc(rad_ib)) %>% 
  slice_head(n = 3)
top_trees$treeID
```

The top 3 trees in stand 5 have the IDs 128, 157, and 135.

## 4. Reducing Columns

### Question 9: Reduce dataset and find smallest 3 trees in stand 3 (2007)

```{r}
smallest_trees <- tree_dat %>% 
  select(treeID, stand, year, rad_ib) %>% 
  filter(stand == 3, year == 2007) %>% 
  slice_min(rad_ib, n = 3)
smallest_trees
```

The three smallest trees in stand 3 are

### Question 10: Remove `stand` column and use `glimpse()`

```{r}
tree_dat_mod <- tree_dat %>% select(-stand)
glimpse(tree_dat_mod)
```

### Question 11-12: Select columns with 'ID' or 'stand' in name

```{r}
id_stand_cols <- tree_dat %>% select(contains("ID") | contains("stand"))
glimpse(id_stand_cols)
```

## 5. Renaming Columns

### Question 13: Rename columns

```{r}
tree_dat <- tree_dat %>% rename(rad_inc_cm = rad_ib, inc_cm = inc)
glimpse(tree_dat)
```

## 6. Creating New Columns

### Question 14: Compute DBH and basal area (BA)

```{r}
tree_dat <- tree_dat %>% 
  mutate(DBH_cm = rad_inc_cm * 2, 
         BA_m2 = 0.00007854 * (DBH_cm^2))
mean_BA_POTR <- tree_dat %>% 
  filter(species == "POTR", year == 2007) %>% 
  summarize(mean_BA = mean(BA_m2, na.rm = TRUE))
mean_BA_POTR
```

The mean BA of the species POTR is 3.7 m\^2 in 2007.

## 7. Using `if_else` and `case_when`

### Question 15: Add `established` column

```{r}
tree_dat <- tree_dat %>% mutate(established = if_else(age > 5, TRUE, FALSE))
established_count <- tree_dat %>% count(established)
established_count
```

There are 122,503 established trees.

### Question 16: Classify trees by `DBH_class`

```{r}
tree_dat <- tree_dat %>% 
  mutate(DBH_class = case_when(
    DBH_cm < 2.5 ~ "seedling",
    DBH_cm < 10 ~ "sapling",
    DBH_cm < 30 ~ "pole",
    TRUE ~ "sawlog"
  ))
class_count <- tree_dat %>% filter(year == 2007) %>% count(DBH_class)
class_count
```

There are 2,291 sawlogs.

## 8. Summarizing Data

### Question 17: Compute mean and standard deviation of DBH

```{r}
summary_2007 <- tree_dat %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  summarize(mean_DBH = mean(DBH_cm, na.rm = TRUE), sd_DBH = sd(DBH_cm, na.rm = TRUE))
summary_2007
```

The mean_DBH of 160.9cm is the average diameter at breast height. It gives a central measure of tree size in that year. The standard deviation was 61.4cm. This shows how much variation exists among tree sizes.

## 9. Grouping Data

### Question 18: Compute mean tree age per species in 2003

```{r}
mean_age_2003 <- tree_dat %>% 
  filter(year == 2003) %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_age))
top_3_species <- head(mean_age_2003, 3)
top_3_species
```

The three species with the oldest mean age are THOC, FRNI, and PIST.

## 10. Counting Records

### Question 19-20: Unique years recorded and stands with most years

```{r}
year_summary <- tree_dat %>% summarize(unique_years = n_distinct(year), first_year = min(year), last_year = max(year))
year_summary

stand_years <- tree_dat %>% group_by(stand) %>% summarize(unique_years = n_distinct(year)) %>% arrange(desc(unique_years))
top_stands <- stand_years %>% filter(unique_years == max(unique_years))
top_stands
```

There are 111 unique years in the dataset. The first year was 1897 and the last year was 2007.

## Final Question: Compute growth rates and find fastest/slowest growing species

```{r}
growth_rates <- tree_dat %>% 
  group_by(treeID) %>% 
  arrange(year) %>% 
  mutate(annual_growth = DBH_cm - lag(DBH_cm)) %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(mean_growth = mean(annual_growth, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_growth))

top_3_fastest <- head(growth_rates, 3)
top_3_slowest <- tail(growth_rates, 3)
top_3_fastest
top_3_slowest
```

The 3 species with the fastest growth are PIRE, POTR, and PIBA. The 3 with the slowest growth are QURU, THOC, and LALA.
